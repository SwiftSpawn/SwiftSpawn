Hello! You can call me whatever you like/come up with a nickname. Pronouns I prefer are he/him or they/them

Unless I'm talking to someone, I'm mostly afk/semi afk so if you want to interact please whisper because it's very unlikely I check public chat!!

I know this kind of makes sense but PLEASE do not copy any of my skins, there's a thing called "inspiration", and you can just come up with your own skins

Some of my fandoms because why not: FNaF, Regretevator, Murder Drones, PokÃ©mon, Poppy Playtime, LHG, Forsaken(I don't play the game), Warrior Cats, TADC, Sonic, DW (Kinda), Gasa4, SCT and I don't feel like naming the rest. I also really like neon/glowing stuff!

-Kins: Broken Spawn, Cyn, Shelly (DW), Nine the Fox, CatNap, Dandicus Dancifer (In order of how much I kin)

Anyway if you wanna be my friend or talk, feel free to! But just so you know, I am overly sensitive, so think a little bit over what you say to me, but most of the time I wouldn't really mind,,, Also I get close with people really easily so yeah I tend to act weird and clingy

BYEE ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜¼
